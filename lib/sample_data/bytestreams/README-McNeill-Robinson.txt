ARTICLE DESCRITPION

These data sets support the journal article:

McNeill, Matthew S.; Robinson Gene E. (2015): Voxel based analysis of the immediate early gene, c-jun, in the honey bee brain after a sucrose stimulus. Insect Molecular Biology doi:10.1111/imb.12165

FILE DESCRIPTION

Brain_Images.zip

Includes all of the individual brain image data sets. This file also contains a *.xlsx file describing the time points (in minutes) at which each data set was collected and whether each individual data set was included in the final analysis. Reasons for removal are included in the journal article Methods section. 

BrainModel_and_Masks.zip

This files contains two images. One image is a honey bee brain model, and the other is a mask representing cell-body containing brain regions of the bee brain. 

METHODS DESCRIPTION
