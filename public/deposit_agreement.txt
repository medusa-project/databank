ILLINOIS DATA BANK DEPOSIT AGREEMENT
Non-Exclusive Distribution and Preservation License

To properly administer the Illinois Data Bank and preserve the contents for future use, the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois on behalf of its Urbana-Champaign campus (the "University") requires certain permissions and warrants from you, the Creator(s) and/or copyright owner. If copyright law is applicable to your dataset submission (see Illinois Data Bank Help section: Research Data Copyright and Licensing, http://databank.illinois.edu/help#license) and you are the copyright owner, by accepting this agreement ("Deposit Agreement" or "License"), you still retain copyright to your work and do not give up the right to submit the Dataset to publishers or other repositories. If you are not the copyright owner, you represent that the copyright owner has given you permission to make the Dataset publicly available.

By accepting (clicking through) this License, you grant to the University the non-exclusive right to reproduce, translate (as described below), and distribute the Dataset in any format or medium worldwide and royalty-free, including, but not limited to, publication over the Internet, unless otherwise provided for by an addendum to this Deposit Agreement. You must contact Research Data Service staff at databank@library.illinois.edu if you would like an addendum to this Deposit Agreement to be considered.

You agree that the University may convert the deposited Data Files and/or Metadata Files to any medium or format and make multiple copies of the deposited Dataset for the purposes of security, back-up, and preservation. In addition, you understand and agree that Research Data Service staff may make changes to Descriptive Metadata, including enhancements (such as addition of key words) and/or corrections (such as minor typos). Any Descriptive Metadata changes will be tracked via a public change log. Your Dataset will not otherwise be altered without your permission.

You understand that the name of the Depositor as well as the name and email address of the Long-Term Contact Person may be displayed with the published Dataset, as will the copyright license selected by the Depositor.

You understand that the University commits to preserving your published Dataset in accordance with the Illinois Data Bank Preservation Policy (http://databank.illinois.edu/policies#preservation_policy). The University also commits to providing public access of Datasets through maintenance of persistent Illinois Data Bank webpages, Descriptive Metadata records, and identifiers, and to providing access metrics, which may include page-views, downloads, and citations. The University currently commits to this level of preservation, access, and reporting for a period of at least five years from the date of publication via the Illinois Data Bank. The University will endeavor to retain the Dataset beyond the initial five-year commitment, but reserves the right to review the long-term viability of the Dataset beyond the initial five-year commitment and the right to Deaccession the Data Files and/or Metadata Files or otherwise alter the availability of the Data Files, Metadata Files, and/or Descriptive Metadata after the initial five years in the University's sole discretion. Generally, the University will endeavor to retain at least the Descriptive Metadata beyond the initial commitment. To learn how to increase the likelihood that published Data Files and Metadata Files will be preserved beyond the initial five year commitment, please see the Illinois Data Bank Preservation Review Guidelines (http://databank.illinois.edu/policies#preservation_guidelines.
