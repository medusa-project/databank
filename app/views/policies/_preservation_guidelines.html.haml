  %h2 Illinois Data Bank Preservation Review Guidelines
  %hr/
  %p
    The Research Data Service will convene Assessment Teams who will determine the long-term viability of Datasets
    published in the Illinois Data Bank. Preservation Review of any given Dataset will not be completed prior to the
    end of the Illinois Data Bank's commitment period, currently five years. The Research Data Service is committed to
    transparency, accountability, and collaborative decision-making regarding assessments of the long-term
    preservation status of research data. While a variety of unique factors influence decisions made about the
    Disposition of Datasets, the criteria outlined in this document provide a basis for assessing Datasets.
