  %h2 Illinois Data Bank Preservation Policy
  %hr/
  %h3 Purpose of this Policy
  %p
    This document outlines the Illinois Data Bank plan for responsible and sustainable stewardship of published
    Datasets. The development of a reliable digital archive that adheres to, and remains compliant with, the standards
    expounded in the Illinois Data Bank Policies remains the best mechanism to support the access of University of
    Illinois at Urbana-Champaign research data.
  %h3 Preservation Objectives
  %p
    The Illinois Data Bank's current objectives are to provide preservation of and access to published research data
    for a minimum of five years after the date of publication in the Illinois Data Bank.
  %p
    The Illinois Data Bank reserves the right to review Datasets five years after their initial publication date to
    determine whether to retain or Deaccession the Data File(s) and/or Metadata File(s). In certain cases of
    retention, preservation review decisions may also trigger preservation actions to ensure the ongoing usability of
    Data Files and/or Metadata Files.
  %p
    The Illinois Data Bank currently plans to retain Descriptive Metadata persistently for all Datasets deposited in
    the Illinois Data Bank regardless of the Disposition of Data File(s) and/or Metadata File(s), but the Illinois
    Data Bank reserves the right to a shorter retention period for Descriptive Metadata, but not shorter than the planned retention period,
    which is currently at five years. Details regarding the process for determining whether to retain Datasets beyond
    the five-year commitment period can be found in the

  %h3 Operating Principles
  %p The Illinois Data Bank shall adhere to the following operating principles:
  %ul
    %li
      %p
        Endeavor to model services after the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model (
        %a{:href => "http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0m2.pdf"}> http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0m2.pdf
        ) for the long-term preservation and access of
        digital collections whenever possible.

        maintaining provenance, chain of custody, authenticity, and integrity of Datasets.
    %li
      %p Comply with intellectual property, copyright, and ownership rights for all content.
  %h3 Roles and Responsibilities
  %p
    Development and management of preservation and access for the Illinois Data Bank is accomplished through the
    collaborative efforts of units at the University Library working in accessioning, curation, information
    technology, and systems administration capacities. These groups further work with the Office of the Vice
    Chancellor of Research and Innovation, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and other groups as necessary to
    provide adequate managerial and infrastructure commitments to sustain the Illinois Data Bank. The Illinois Data
    Bank's preservation infrastructure is managed by the Library and its Medusa digital preservation repository (see
    below).
  %h3 Preservation Strategies
  %p
    Datasets deposited in the Illinois Data Bank utilize the back-end storage and management services within Medusa,
    the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library's digital preservation repository (
    %a{:href => "https://medusa.library.illinois.edu/"}> https://medusa.library.illinois.edu/
    ). Medusa provides a common storage and management infrastructure for
    digital collections of enduring value to the University. At present, Medusa's collecting focus is on digitized and
    "born digital" books, manuscripts, photographs, audiovisual materials, scholarly publications, and research data
    from the Library's special collections, general collections, and institutional repositories. The University
    Library manages Medusa storage in partnership with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Additional
    information about Digital Repository Medusa can be found at the Medusa's FAQs page (
    %a{:href => "https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/LibraryDigitalPreservation/Medusa+FAQ"}> https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/LibraryDigitalPreservation/Medusa+FAQ
    ).
  %p
    As is practical and necessary, preservation procedures may also include transformation of Data Files and/or
    Metadata Files into more stable formats and/or migration to successive formats. In the event one or more Data
    Files and/or Metadata Files in a Dataset are made available in a converted format, Research Data Service staff
    will document the conversion in the Dataset's associated Descriptive Metadata and/or Metadata File(s).
  %h3 Addressing Challenges
  %p The Illinois Data Bank plans to address the challenges facing digital repositories as follows:
  %ul
    %li
      %p
        %strong Technological Change:
        By developing a sustainable digital preservation model that
        will respond to technological changes as needed without under- or over-estimating the costs imposed by these
        changes.
    %li
      %p
        %strong Sustainability:
        By developing a sustainable digital preservation model that will deal
        with the technical and management challenges of preserving digital content within the constraints of available
        funding.
    %li
      %p
        %strong Defining Preservation Needs:
        By providing a thoughtful balance among many factors
        including access, functionality, and preservation, while being mindful that preservation is critical to enabling
        long-term access and use.
    %li
      %p
        %strong Ongoing Monitoring of Submitted Material Types and Formats:
        By monitoring different
        needs of the deposited materials (e.g., storage size, file format usability) as different types of materials are
        deposited and maintaining procedures and guidance based on these needs as necessary.
  %h3 Financial Sustainability
  %p
    The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign makes a financial commitment toward the sustainable preservation
    of published Datasets through funding of the Research Data Service.
  %h3 Technological Sustainability, Security, and Disaster Recovery
  %p
    The University Library is committed to sustaining an effective digital preservation infrastructure for its
    digital collections, which includes the adequate provisioning of appropriate technologies. Planning for this
    infrastructure occurs within the Library's Repository group, in conjunction with Research Data Service staff. To
    minimize service interruption and content loss due to technical failure, the system is designed to eliminate
    single points of failure by providing redundant server components and replication; however, the Illinois Data Bank
    service is provided "as is."
  %ul
    %li
      %p
        %strong Replication of Repository Content:
        Datasets deposited into the Illinois Data Bank are stored in highly durable, available and performant
        object storage, with copies in more than one geographic area.
    %li
      %p
        %strong Geographical Redundancy:
        To minimize loss due to catastrophic hardware failure or
        natural disaster, all repository content is regularly backed up to remote storage to ensure geographic
        redundancy and disaster recovery.
    %li
      %p
        %strong High Availability:
        The Library's repository services are designed to quickly recover
        from the failure of some of its components and to continue working to a level of satisfaction in the presence
        of hardware or software failure.
