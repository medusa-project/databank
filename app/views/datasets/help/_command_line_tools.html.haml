        These tools can be used to upload files an existing draft dataset in the Illinois Data Bank.
    %h4 What do we mean by a draft dataset?
    .indent
      %p
        A dataset is in a draft state in the Illinois Data Bank after the deposit agreement has been accepted and before the dataset is published or scheduled for publication.  Before uploading a file using any of these options,
        %a(href="/datasets/new" target="_blank" ) create
        or
        %a(href="/datasets" target="_blank" ) find
        your draft dataset, and navigate to the edit form for that dataset.

    %h4 How do I get started?
    .indent
      %p
        At the bottom of the Files section of any draft dataset is a matrix of upload options buttons.
        %br
        Click the
        %em Get token for command line tools
        button to display required elements for use in command line tools.

    %h4 Notes:
    %ul
      %li
        %p Anyone can use a token to upload a file to this dataset, so keep it secure.
      %li
        %p A distinct token is required for each dataset.

          %em Get token for command line tools
          button when editing a draft dataset. The only part that would need to change from that example would be the name of your file at the end where that example has

          A version of the following example command, pre-populated with your dataset identifier and token, comes up in response to clicking on the
          %em Get token for command line tools
          button when editing a draft dataset. The only part that would need to change from that example is the name of your file in the "binary = @my_datafile.csv" section. The at symbol (@) is required just before the file name.

        .curl-to-copy
          %pre
            %code
              = %Q[curl -F "binary=@my_datafile.csv" -H "Authorization: Token token=[TOKEN]" -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" -X POST #{IDB_CONFIG[:root_url_text]}/api/dataset/[DATASET_IDENTIFIER]/datafile -o output.txt]

                = %Q[-k]

        %p
          The basic endpoint URL pattern is
          = %Q[#{IDB_CONFIG[:root_url_text]}/api/dataset/[DATASET_IDENTIFIER]/datafile]
        %p The request method is POST.
        %p The authorization token must be sent in a header.
        %p A header setting the Transfer-Encoding to chunked is recommended.
        %p The file must be sent in a form in an element named binary.  In cURL, that can be done with the -F option and an element like "binary=@my_datafile.csv".
        %p The -o option must be used to send response output to a file to see the progress meter.
        %p Even after the cURL progress meter reaches 100%, additional processing is done, which may take as long as it took to reach 100%.
        -if IDB_CONFIG[:root_url_text].include?("dev") or IDB_CONFIG[:root_url_text].include?("demo")
          %p For the development/demonstration server only, -k at at the end of the cURL command makes it tolerate the self-signed certificate.
        -else
        %p After upload is complete, refresh the dataset page to see the new datafile listing.
